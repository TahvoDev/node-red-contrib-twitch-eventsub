### Features

- Listening to events from Twitch (e.g. Follows, Reward requests, Bans, ...)
  The complete list of subscription types can be found here : https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-subscription-types

### Setup
#### Twitch app
1. Create a twitch application here: https://dev.twitch.tv/console.
   - Get the Client ID and the Secret Client and put these values in `Twitch Client ID` and `Twitch Client Secret` fields.
   - On the app you must also configure an OAuth redirect URI.
   - Choose the port you want to use in the `Server Port` field, then configure this URL:\
   `http://localhost:[CHOSEN_PORT]/oauth`\
   *(make sure the port is the same as the one configured on the var `Server Port`)*

2. **üöß This is currently hardcoded. Subscribed events are : `channel.follow, channel.subscribe, channel.subscription.message, channel.cheer, stream.online, stream.offline, channel.raid, channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add`**\
   **You can skip this step for now.**\
   Define the events you want to subscribe to in the `Subscribe to events` field.\
